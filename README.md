# hello-world
Sample repository

Hello! This is my first time using github, and this project was created to learn the basics of how github works. I'm supposed to write about myself: I went to Japan when I was one year old, and want desperately to go back so I can have actual memories of it. I can listen to heavy metal, disco, post-punk, classical, hip-hop, and jazz in the same sitting without feeling uncomfortable.
